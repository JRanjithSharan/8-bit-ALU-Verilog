# 8-bit ALU in Verilog

## Project Overview
This project implements an **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** in **Verilog HDL**.  
An ALU is a critical component of any processor, responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations. It serves as the computational core of CPUs, DSPs, and other digital systems.

This design demonstrates a parameterized and modular approach to ALU design, making it suitable for both learning and practical digital design projects.

## Features
The ALU supports **16 operations**, including:

- **Arithmetic:** Addition, Subtraction  
- **Logic:** AND, OR, XOR, NOT  
- **Shifts:** Logical Shift Left (LSL), Logical Shift Right (LSR), Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR)  
- **Comparisons:** Greater than, Less than, Equal  
- **Other operations:** Increment, Decrement  

The design includes:

- Parameterized **8-bit width**
- Modular RTL for easy extension
- Testbench for functional verification
- Simulation outputs for waveform analysis
